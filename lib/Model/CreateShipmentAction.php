/**
 * PRO SHIPPING API
 *
 * # Introduction Here you will find requirements for integrating with PRO SHIPPING API.  The documentation specifically covers how the API can be used by business customers to conduct shipping activity with available carriers and provides the technical information to build this integration. The API allows customers to create and manage shipments, produce labels, customs documentation, and collection manifests, retrieve reference data such as carriers and countries, and maintain their own data such as shipping account details.  Pro Shipping API is a fully RESTful service implemented using JSON messaging. You, as the customer are responsible for sending JSON messages and for maintaining the capability of receiving JSON messages in the format described in this specification. Request and response examples for each API service are included in this specification.  # Authentication  The PRO SHIPPING API uses OAuth2 authentication.  To request the authorization token you need to create API credentials (Client ID and Secret) on the system first. If you have not done it already, log into your account and go to API Credentials or follow the link [add a link here with the path to the API Credentials menu]. Use the credentials to retrieve the authorization token.  Note: Make sure you copy the Secret and keep it secure as you won't be able to view it again on the system.  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <SecurityDefinitions /> -->

 * @description Determines the shipment status that is set on shipment creation and whether a shipment tracking number and labels are generated.     &lt;br /&gt;Valid values are:  &lt;br /&gt;**Process** - creates a shipment tracking number, creates and prints a label for each package in the shipment and returns the label(s) in the createShipment Response. The shipment status will be set to Ready to Manifest. &lt;br /&gt;**Create** - creates the shipment but does not allocate a tracking number, print the label(s) or return the label(s) in the createShipment Response. The label(s) must be printed before the shipment is ready to manifest. &lt;br /&gt;**Allocate** - creates the tracking number and label(s) but does not print the label(s) or return label(s) in the createShipment response. The label(s) must be printed before the shipment is ready to manifest. &lt;br /&gt;Defaults to Process if not populated.
